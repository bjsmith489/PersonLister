# PersonLister

This Person Lister is an advanced person lister finder application. It pulls in data from a rest API for its users, allowing a special user to be created as the owner and persists the data using the Room API. The information is alterable for the owner. The application additionally utilizes the Picasso API to manage images in a successful manner. The Persons in the application are also found by using OkHttp3 API. An activity attached to the recycler view on the main page allows you to switch between an informational fragment and a Google Maps fragment. The location of the ping on the Google Maps fragment is parsed from the information pulled in from OkHttp3, attached to the specific person.
